# Urbanism Generator (Assignment #4)

- Author: Mujtaba Zaidi

### What is this new project?

This new project extends the prior implementation of Island generation on an irregular mesh by adding cities and road
networks between them. It includes a shortest path finding algorithm, namely Dijkstra's algorithm due to its efficiency
and ability to map out all shortest paths to a source node. It also includes a graph abstract data type implementation
and its associated node and edges types that help facilitate its representation. A minimum priority queue representation
was also built to help facilitate the best case complexity implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.
